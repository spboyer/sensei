## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Tailwind v4 uses @tailwindcss/vite, not @astrojs/tailwind; CSS-first config via @theme directives — decided by Rusty
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Astro site lives in docs/ subdirectory; worktree on feat/gh-pages-site branch — decided by Rusty
📌 Team update (2026-02-09): Landing page complete — 7 components (Hero, Problem, HowItWorks, BeforeAfter, ScoringLevels, QuickStart, Footer), all self-contained, no external JS — built by Linus
📌 Content update (2026-02-09): Social posts rewritten for platform compliance — LinkedIn: no markdown, links in first comment, engagement hooks at end, personal voice from Shayne. X: thread format for all posts, 280 char limit per tweet, 0 hashtags. All 4 post angles preserved (Launch, Before/After, Skill Collision, OSS Invite) — by Basher
📌 Content update (2026-02-09): Blog post (sensei-launch.md) reviewed and strengthened — added byline, scale paragraph in hook, contributor CTA in closing section. Core flow (Hook → Checks → Before/After → Ralph Loop → Getting Started → CTA) validated as solid — by Basher
📌 Content rule (2026-02-09): LinkedIn posts must never contain markdown (backticks, code blocks, headers) — the platform doesn't render it and it looks broken. Use plain text, unicode, and emoji for formatting instead — established by Basher
📌 Content rule (2026-02-09): LinkedIn posts should use "Link in first comment" pattern — putting URLs in the post body kills algorithmic reach. Note with 🔗 emoji at end — established by Basher
📌 Content fix (2026-02-17): Blog post (sensei-launch.md) — re-applied two previously-approved fixes that got overwritten: (1) Broadened Anthropic reference from "builds on" to "informed by" — Sensei draws from multiple influences, not just Anthropic's spec. (2) Replaced Azure-specific INVOKES/FOR SINGLE OPERATIONS examples with generic pdf-tools MCP examples matching the post's pdf-processor theme. Key file: docs/blog/sensei-launch.md — by Basher
📌 Team update (2026-02-17): Blog post examples must use generic/themed references (pdf-processor), not Azure-specific MCP tools; Anthropic uses "informed by" framing — decided by Basher
