## What happened

Basher integrated industry research into `docs/blog/sensei-launch.md`. ~250 words added across 5 insertion points:

- **GitHub 2,500-repo analysis** — large-scale study data on skill/prompt quality patterns
- **arxiv 26% vulnerability stat** — research finding that 26% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities
- **Lost-in-the-middle bias** — cognitive/LLM bias where mid-document content gets lower attention
- **Maintenance drift scenario** — illustrative example of skill degradation over time without scoring
- **Patronus AI multi-agent findings** — research on multi-agent system reliability and failure modes

## Changes

- `docs/blog/sensei-launch.md` — 5 research citations woven into existing sections

## Decisions

None.
