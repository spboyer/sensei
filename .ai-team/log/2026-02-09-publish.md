**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## What Happened

1. Rusty (Lead) merged `feat/gh-pages-site` into `main` — clean merge, no conflicts, 21 files added.
2. Pushed to `origin/main` via `credential.helper=wincred` (browser-based auth).
3. GitHub Actions workflow `deploy-pages.yml` triggered — build job passed, deploy job failed (404 — Pages not enabled on repo).
4. Worktree at `C:\Users\shboyer\GitHub\sensei-site` removed; local `feat/gh-pages-site` branch deleted.

## Action Required

Enable GitHub Pages: **Settings → Pages → Source → "GitHub Actions"**. Then re-run the failed workflow or push a change to `docs/`. Site URL: `https://spboyer.github.io/sensei/`.
