# Session: 2026-02-17-readme-update

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## Summary

Shayne noticed `docs/README.md` was still the default Astro starter boilerplate. Basher rewrote it to document the actual Sensei site — project structure, commands, deployment pipeline, design system, component inventory.

## Agents Involved

- **Basher** — rewrote `docs/README.md`

## Decisions

- docs/README.md now documents the actual project, not Astro boilerplate (see decisions.md)
