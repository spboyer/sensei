# Session: 2026-02-17-blog-content-fixes

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer
**Agent:** Basher

## What happened

Basher re-applied two previously approved fixes in `docs/blog/sensei-launch.md` that had been reverted by a rewrite:

1. **Line 25** — Broadened Anthropic reference from "builds on" to "informed by" framing.
2. **Lines 89, 94** — Replaced Azure-specific MCP examples (`azure-azd`, `azure-deploy`) with generic `pdf-tools` MCP / `file-system` examples matching the post's pdf-processor theme.

## Decision logged

- `basher-content-fixes-feb17.md` merged into `decisions.md`.
