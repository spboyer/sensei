# Session: 2026-02-18-v1-release

**Requested by:** Shayne Boyer

## What happened

- Basher drafted release notes for v1.0.0.
- GitHub Release created at https://github.com/spboyer/sensei/releases/tag/v1.0.0.
- Release notes frame all features as Sensei's built-in capabilities (not paper integration), per Shayne's directive.
- Tag v1.0.0 pushed to origin.

## Decisions

- v1.0.0 release framing: advisory checks presented as Sensei's native intelligence, not external research integration. Applies to all future public-facing content.
