# Session: 2026-02-17-linkedin-tables

- **Requested by:** Shayne Boyer
- **Agent:** Basher
- **Date:** 2026-02-17

## Summary

Shayne flagged that sensei-launch.md uses markdown tables which don't render on LinkedIn Articles. Basher replaced all 4 markdown tables (Identity checks, Routing checks, Integration checks, Scoring levels) with bold-label definition lists. Directive captured: no markdown tables in LinkedIn content.

## Decisions

- No markdown tables in LinkedIn Articles content — use bold-label definition lists instead (`**Label** — Description.`)
- User directive captured: LinkedIn Articles don't support markdown tables well
